Wait:
    Implicit wait: We wait until the box shows
    Whenever we are waiting for an element to be found we use implicit wait.
    Implicit wait is going to wait until"The WEBELEMENT IS FOUND"
    1)if the element is found , it will end the wait time and move on.
    2)if the element is not found, (in the duration of time out) it will return us with exception.

    Explicit wait: We use explicit wait  to wait for a certain condition to be fulfilled.
    Explicit wait is going to wait until the webElement fulfills the condition
    1)as soon as the condition is fulfilled it moves on to the Next line of Code
    2) If the condition isn't fulfilled(in the duration of time out), it will give an exception.
