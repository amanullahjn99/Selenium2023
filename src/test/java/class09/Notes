KEYS performs keyboard operations:
locate  the web Element
and send  keys(Keys.ENTER/TAB/ESCAPE/DELETE)
Use Case:

if a user story requires to enter key operation
or you can also use KEYS.DELETE to delete if clear command does not work


Action class allows us to do operations such as mimicking mouse operations:
Hover over
Drag and drop
Right click (ContextClick)
Double click
Simple click
etc

Use built when calling multiple methods in Actions class

The build() method in Selenium is used to create a composite action
that contains all the actions gathered which are ready to be performed.
The perform() method is used to execute the chain of actions which are built using the
Action build method.
USAGE:
1) Declare the instance
                  Actions action=new Actions(driver);
2) action.ContextClick(WebElement).perform();
3) another way to duse Actions class - use built() method when calling multiple methods in a row:
                  action.clickAndHold(draggable).moveToElement(droppable).release().build().perform();


Why do we need screenshots in testing?
in testing it is very important to take screenshots in order to prove the our test case
covered certain functionality

In selenium in order to take a screenshot we will be using
TakesScreenshot interface

Actions class:
is given by selenium to capture keyboard and mouse events such as:
Move to element
Drag and drop
double click
right click

1- Keys: Key are used to send a key to a webElement
    1.locate the webElement
    2.webElement.sendkeys(Keys.Enter/Tab/Esc))

 Use case:
    if a user story says that user hits enter key, u can use keys to mimic the enter key operation
    or u can also use Keys. Delete to delete if clear command isn't working

2- Action class:
    i)declare the instance of aciotn class
    ii)Use the objet to call the function available
    action.contextClick (WebElement).perform().
    action.click(WebElement).perform().
    action.moveToElement(WebElement).perform().
 When ever u chain diff methods use. build at end to build the chain of actions and perform to execute them,
    action.clickAndHold().moveToElement().Release().build().perform().
 use case:
    drag and drop, right click (context click), scroll,hover


 3- js Executor: allows us to execute java script
        i) declare the instance
        ii)js.execute-script(script,element)
  from where u will get the script? google

  What is the the most common jsExecutescript functionality used---> click()

  because sometimes the regular click operation doesn't work and at that print js click will work

 Use Case:
    scroll, click, highlight the element boundary

4- Take screenShot

    i)declare the instance
        TakesScreenShot ts=(TakesScreenShot)driver;

    ii) take screenshot
        file screenShot=ts.getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);

    iii) to save the screenshot
        FileUtils.copyFile(screenShot,new File(path));

Dependency needed to save the screenshot---> commons-io

FileUtils.copyFile(screenShot,new File(path));
    foler where u want to save the screenshot

    system.getProperty(usr.dir)+"/screenshot" +filename+extension

    return u with the current directory path

Use Case:
    take screenshot if test case passed and also if it failed
